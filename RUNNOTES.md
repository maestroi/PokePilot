## S6-12 — Badge harness landed; scoreboard is VOID

### What landed (restored from snapshot commit 3b98489, no new logic)
- `cmd/badgerun/`: sweep harness — llm planner to the Boulder Badge per
  starter/seed, prints a table. Tests cover arg parsing + table format only;
  not part of `go test ./...`.
- `agent/llm.go`: `PromptLog`, `ExtraSystem` (the -inject-fact seam),
  `Timeout` (POKEPILOT_LLM_TIMEOUT). Restored because the harness references
  all three and the current file was exactly the snapshot version minus them.
- `emu/emu.go`: `OnFrame` — headless runs now get the dialogue tape
  (agent.Run's OnSample install was dead code without a Watch).
- `skill/story.go`: GetStarter no longer requires WINNING the rival battle
  (seed-dependent outcome; ROM proceeds identically either way).
- `docs/AGENT.md`: badgerun section. `-inject-fact` defaults OFF, verified in
  code: `fs.Bool("inject-fact", false, ...)`. No `badgerun-out/`, `.log` or
  `.state` file committed.

### The scoreboard is VOID. Four measured reasons:
1. **Single-slot contention.** badgerun and this coding agent share one
   inference slot (server :8002, model qwen3.8-27b). Every 27b sweep died on
   its FIRST call: "context deadline exceeded ... awaiting headers", 0
   frames. GET /v1/models answered in 0.3ms; POST timed out at 90s. Attempt
   1's baseline completed only because it used the default qwen3.5-4b.
2. **No goal in the prompt.** agent/llm.go's system prompt has no objective
   (`grep -ri goal agent/` → nothing). Runs measure an unprompted model with
   a menu.
3. **A superfluous argument kills the run.** Attempt 1's baseline: 9 of 9
   runs ended in error, 27 "argument does not apply" rejections, 0 badges.
4. **No model verification.** chatResponse parses only "choices" — no model,
   no finish_reason — so ablation A cannot detect a different model served.

**NO recall-vs-derivation reading is possible from these runs, and none is
offered.** No completion rate, no capability claim. The real measurement
moves to slice 7 (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-slice7-design.md) after
the goal, reply validation and rejection recovery land.

### For the next task
- Smoke run NOT executed: 192.168.50.204:8000 returns 401 without a bearer
  token and no `.env`/`llm_token` exists in this worktree. Harness verified
  via build + vet + `-short` suite (all ok, 0 skips).
- Do NOT run sweeps from inside agent-runner (single-slot contention).
- S6-11 (prev): per-objective checkpoint ring in agent.Run; plain
  `fixture.LoadState`.

## S7-1: fixture cache survives a clean worktree

`fixture.Dir` replaced by `DefaultDir` + `ResolveDir()` in
skill/fixture/fixture.go; `POKEPILOT_FIXTURE_DIR` overrides the cache
location. `FailureDir` untouched. Two unit tests added to fixture_test.go.

Cache-reuse measurement (same POKEPILOT_FIXTURE_DIR=/tmp/pokepilot-fixtures,
POKEMON_RED_ROM set, `go test ./skill/fixture -count=1`):

- cold (empty dir):  **43.227s**
- warm (reused):     **1.708s**

/tmp/pokepilot-fixtures now holds: reds_bedroom.v5.state,
post_starter.v5.state, pallet_town.v5.state, viridian_city.v5.state,
viridian_pokecenter.v5.state.

For the next task: set POKEPILOT_FIXTURE_DIR to a shared path (e.g.
/tmp/pokepilot-fixtures) when running the suite — clean worktrees no longer
rebuild post_starter/post_pokeballs from boot.
